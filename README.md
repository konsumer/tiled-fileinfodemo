# tiled-fileinfodemo

This is a demo plugin for the new [FileInfo](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfileinfo.html) object for [tiled](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled) plugins.

It doesn't actually do anyhting, by itself, really, but you can use it to work out how to get info about files in a tiled plugin.

## usage

Extract the folder to your plugin dir, and export "File Info" for a JSON file with lots of info.
